# Phone Plan

Employees who are part of the _Operations Team_ (MDs, OMs, management team) tend to regularly use their cell phones for work purposes.  The company will cover up to $150 per month of phone plan expense for these employees.

To begin using this benefit, send a screenshot of your first bill to shoeboxed.com, and then just start paying with your thoughtbot credit card.

If you have a backlog of old bills, send those to reimbursements@thoughtbot.com and ask to be reimbursed.
