# Conferences

The company will pay 50% of all expenses for approved job-related conferences and seminars.  If you're speaking at the conference, we'll pay 100% of the expenses.

## Eligibility

All full-time employees can take advantage of this benefit upon starting with thoughtbot.

## Sign-up

Follow the instructions on the [Conferences Trello board][trello].

[trello]: https://trello.com/b/ja0PVibp/conferences

Your office manager will book your travel & purchase your ticket.

If you are signing-up for a conference that sells out quickly,
please purchase the ticket yourself on your company card,
email the receipt to reimbursements &
note on the Trello card that the ticket has already been purchased.

## Expenses while at the conference

Use your company card for meals & transportation while at the conference. Then email all the receipts to reimbursements@thoughtbot.com so that the 50% you owe can be deducted from your paycheck. Please write the names of any other people included in the purchase on the receipt.
